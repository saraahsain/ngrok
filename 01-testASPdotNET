In my own experience, it didn't work when I run the project and it's configured with SSL
1- If your local project is configured to run on SSL:
- Go to property pages -> WEB -> change from https:// to http:// 
- And then put SSL to false
2- Run your project 
3- Windows + R
4- CMD
5- ngrok http [PORT] -host-header="localhost:[PORT]"

You can then send any API call with the https:// URL ngrok provides and track traffic http://localhost:4040
